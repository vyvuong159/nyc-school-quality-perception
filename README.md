## Conclusions
- Student and teacher perceptions about safety, student perception about academic expectations appear to be positively related academic success metric. In contrast, student, parent and teacher perceptions of safety are negatively associated with the percentage of students receiving special education. This means, the higher the rate of students that need  attention for their learning or physical special needs in a school, the lower trust that students, teachers and parents put in that school safety. The same applies for the relationship between the student perception of communication, engagement and academic expectations and the special education rate.
- In terms of the different perceptions among students, teachers and parents of NYC school quality, generally parents rate NYC school quality highest, followed by teachers and finally students. Academic expectations and safety are the two aspects of school quality that are highly evaluated by all groups.
